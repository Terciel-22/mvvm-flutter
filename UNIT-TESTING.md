To unit test a whole class in Flutter, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new test file for your class. The convention is to place test files in the `test/` directory, following your project's directory structure.

2. Import the necessary packages, including `flutter_test.dart` and the file that contains the class you want to test.

3. Define a test group using the `group` function. This helps organize and group related test cases together.

4. Within the test group, use the `test` function to define individual test cases that verify the behavior of your class.

5. Write test cases that cover different scenarios and test various methods and functionalities of your class. Arrange the necessary data, act on the class methods, and assert the expected results using the `expect` function.

Here's an example of how you can unit test a class in Flutter:

```dart
// lib/counter.dart

class Counter {
  int value = 0;

  void increment() {
    value++;
  }

  void decrement() {
    value--;
  }
}
```

```dart
// test/counter_test.dart

import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:your_app_name/counter.dart';

void main() {
  group('Counter', () {
    test('Initial value should be 0', () {
      final counter = Counter();

      expect(counter.value, 0);
    });

    test('Increment should increase the value', () {
      final counter = Counter();

      counter.increment();

      expect(counter.value, 1);
    });

    test('Decrement should decrease the value', () {
      final counter = Counter();

      counter.decrement();

      expect(counter.value, -1);
    });
  });
}
```

In this example, we have a `Counter` class with two methods, `increment` and `decrement`, that modify the `value` property of the class. The goal is to test the behavior of these methods.

We define a test group called `'Counter'` using the `group` function. Within this group, we define three test cases using the `test` function. The first test case verifies that the initial value of the counter is 0. The second test case tests the `increment` method by checking if it correctly increases the value. The third test case tests the `decrement` method by checking if it correctly decreases the value.

By running the tests, you can verify whether the class behaves as expected. If all the tests pass, it indicates that the class functions correctly. If any test fails, it helps you identify which specific behavior is not working as intended.
